# C-browser

This is a C implementation of a basic-functionality terminal browser. It uses ncurses for the graphical interface.
After you build the project with "make", just launch the browser with "./bijoo" and use it with the legend on the 
bottom left.

The functionality of the browser is limited, but it was a fun coding challenge in which I used a lot of memory 
management features to optimize the RAM usage. It is written entirely in C.
